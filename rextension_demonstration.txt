How to set up and test the R extension for NetLogo.

1. Set environmental parameters (note: probably different for your machine)

export R_HOME=/usr/lib/R
export JRI_HOME=/usr/lib/R/site-library/rJava/jri

2. Start NetLogo

3. Test R extension:

In code tab, type "extensions [r]" and click "Check".
If NetLogo does not crash, your are good!

Now, open the file "rextension_example.nlogo" 
and go through the test buttons.
If that works, the installation has most probably been successful!
